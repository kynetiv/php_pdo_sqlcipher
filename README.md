#### Sqlcipher Extension for Windows PHP (DLL)

Disclaimer: The built module provided was targeting an older version of PHP, as such, there may be vulnerabilities. Use at your own risk.

This repo provides a built version of [sqlcipher](https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher) as a Windows PHP module (DLL).

Currently it is built for PHP 5.6 (specifically built from PHP 5.6.15 source), which may be the turning away point for many users :(

Built with OpenSSL v.1.0.1u
